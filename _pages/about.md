Hello! My name is SHANTHI LEKKALA

Currently pursuing Master's in Computer Science at CU Boulder, I am a software engineer with a passion for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I enjoy crafting innovative AI solutions to real-world problems, with a fascination that extends to both research and application. Particularly drawn to the security aspect of AI, I am interested in both deploying AI and the process of bringing it to life.

At AIShield, an internal startup at Bosch Global Software Technologies PVT LTD, I worked on understanding the vulnerabilities of Machine Learning/Deep Learning models when deployed. It might be shocking to know that many models are vulnerable to attacks, with attackers motivated by the commercial value of the model.

During the research and development of the AIShield product, I oversaw the product infrastructure, including merging pull requests, maintaining Azure resources, deploying services in Kubernetes, and managing the entire CI/CD pipeline. This experience heightened my interest in product development.

With a robust background in software development and a keen interest in the intersection of technology and artificial intelligence, I am eager to leverage my skills to tackle complex challenges and propel cutting-edge projects forward.

Outside of work, I absolutely love listening to music! Whether it's discovering new tunes or enjoying old favorites, music is a big part of my life. Oh, and I can't forget about the joy of Boulder snow! There's something magical about the snow-covered landscapes of Boulder. Whether it's building snowmen or taking a peaceful walk, I love embracing the beauty of the winter season.
