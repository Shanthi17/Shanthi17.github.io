## AIShield, Bosch Global Software Technologies PVT LTD Bangalore, India
__Senior Data Scientist__, September 2020 - June 2022

* __Product Development:__
    * Contributed to the development of micro-service architecture, created microservices to analyze vulnerability of DL models.
    * Created a new feature to build docker for automated defense creation for any given ML/Dl model.
    * Deployed microservices to Azure Kubernetes, tested the services with Postman, and ensured their scalability.
    * Maintain productâ€™s development, staging, and production environments, and assure end-to-end testing before deployment.
* __Research on Model Extraction Attacks(MEA) and Defenses:__
    * Proved that Image Classification models are 80% vulnerable to ME attacks and extended the analysis to other domains.
    * Contributed to developing 10 defense mechanisms against ME attacks and validated each model-to-defense combination.
    * Deployed MLFlow pipeline for Image Classification model and generated attack vectors to analyze its vulnerability.
