## I love exploring new things!

Pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at CU Boulder. My research interests lie mainly in the domains of Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning. I have almost 3 years of experience in developing cutting-edge AI technology to solve computer vision-based real-world problems.
