1. __Hateful Meme Detection (Deep Learning):__ Developed a transformer based model using Facebook challenge dataset with 10,000 images to identify hate in memes. Utilized caption generated from the meme with BERT and VisualBERT to achieve and AUROC score of 74.3 and accuracy of 69%. __(Dec 2020)__
2. __Human Value Detection - SemEval2023:__ Created a Multi-label BERT classification model to detect different human values behind a textual argument and achieved 74% accuracy when trained on SemEval 2023 dataset with 9000 samples over 54 values. __(Dec 2022)__
3. __People Counting:__ Used Object detection, tracking algorithm to track track people and assist owners with real-time traffic of people entering store with MAE score of 8.4. __(May 2020)__
4. __Recognition and completion of Hand-drawn UI images:__ Developed a model to recognize a partially drawn User interface element based on its stroke sequence and incorporated a suggestion system to auto-complete the sketch using recurrent neural
networks. __( April 2019)__
